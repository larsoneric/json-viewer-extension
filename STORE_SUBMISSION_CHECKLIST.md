View and format JSON from network responses. Auto-detects escaped JSON with syntax highlighting and easy clipboard access.
```

**Detailed Description** (suggested):
```
A DevTools panel that automatically monitors network responses and helps you view, format, and copy data with syntax highlighting.

This extension adds a new tab to Chrome DevTools that watches for network requests and displays them in an easy-to-navigate list. When you click on a request, you can view the full response with color-coded syntax highlighting, making it easier to read and understand API responses.

Features include:
- Automatic detection of escaped strings in responses
- One-click formatting with syntax highlighting
- Copy to clipboard (formatted or raw)
- Search and filter by URL or method
- Recording controls to pause and review
- Full keyboard navigation

Perfect for developers debugging APIs, testing integrations, or working with complex nested data structures. All processing happens locally in your browser - no data is sent to external servers.
